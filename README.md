This repository contains files for the Course Project (week 4) from Exploratory Data Analysis on Coursera.

The files are:

1. **plot1.R and plot1.png**: Have total PM2.5 emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the United States from 1999 to 2008 (1999, 2002, 2005, 2008)? 
2. **plot2.R and plot2.png**: Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the Baltimore City, Maryland ("fips=="24510") from 1999 to 2008? 
3. **plot3.R and plot3.png**: Of the four types of sources indicated by the type (point, nonpoint, onroad, nonroad) variable, which of these four sources have seen decreases in emissions from 1999–2008 for Baltimore City? Which have seen increases in emissions from 1999–2008?
4. **plot4.R and plot4.png**: Across the US, how have emissions from coal combustion-related sources changed from 1999–2008?
5. **plot5.R and plot5.png**: How have emissions from motor vehicle sources changed from 1999–2008 in Baltimore City?
6. **plot6.R and plot6.png**: Compare emissions from motor vehicle sources in Baltimore City with emissions from motor vehicle sources in Los Angeles County, California (fips == "06037"). Which city has seen greater changes over time in motor vehicle emissions?
